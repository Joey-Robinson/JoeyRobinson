      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a self-taught front-end developer. Through the last year, I've taught myself the basics of web development.
        While on this continuing journey, I've learned some amazing things, and look forward to learning & knowing more.
        I can say with certainty that I truly enjoy writing code that is reflected visually for people to enjoy.
        My hope is that in the future, I can make more things people will like and enjoy.
